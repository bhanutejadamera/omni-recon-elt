## üìå Problem Statement
Polo Ralph Lauren receives sales and return data from multiple channels ‚Äî POS, E-commerce, and Third-Party partners ‚Äî in separate raw CSV files. These files: - Arrive in different currencies and are stored in Amazon S3 - Have to be reconciled to produce a unified view of sales - Need to be kept updated automatically without manual loading

**Business Requirements:** - A single fact table combining all channels - Amounts standardized to USD for consistent reporting - Refund transactions identified for tracking returns - Automated daily updates when new files arrive in S3

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented (AWS + Snowflake ELT)
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage & Ingestion
- Created an **S3 bucket** `omni-recon-data` with folders:  
  raw/pos/  
  raw/ecommerce/  
  raw/thirdparty/  
  raw/reference/  
- Uploaded channel-specific CSV files + FX rate file to their respective folders. - Created a **Snowflake storage integration** with AWS IAM role & external stage `@omni_stage` pointing to the S3 bucket.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Automatic Loading (Snowpipe)
- Created **4 Snowpipes**:  
  - `pos_pipe` ‚Üí loads from `raw/pos/` ‚Üí `stage_pos_sales`  
  - `ecommerce_pipe` ‚Üí loads from `raw/ecommerce/` ‚Üí `stage_ecommerce_sales`  
  - `thirdparty_pipe` ‚Üí loads from `raw/thirdparty/` ‚Üí `stage_thirdparty_sales`  
  - `fx_rates_pipe` ‚Üí loads from `raw/reference/` ‚Üí `stage_fx_rates`  
- Configured them to **auto-ingest** new files from S3 into staging tables.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Staging Table Structures
**Sales Staging Tables** (`POS`, `E-commerce`, `Third-Party`):  
transaction_id STRING  
channel STRING  
store_id STRING  
product_id STRING  
currency STRING  
amount_local FLOAT  
refund_flag BOOLEAN  
quantity INT  
datetime_local TIMESTAMP  

**FX Rates Staging Table**:  
date DATE  
currency STRING  
exchange_rate FLOAT

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transformations Implemented
The transformation logic inside Snowflake creates the `sales_reconciliation_fact` table by:  
1. **Merging all sales channels**  
SELECT * FROM stage_pos_sales  
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM stage_ecommerce_sales  
UNION ALL  
SELECT * FROM stage_thirdparty_sales  

2. **Joining with FX rates to standardize amounts in USD**  
ROUND(s.amount_local / f.exchange_rate, 2) AS amount_usd  

3. **Retaining refund_flag** to identify returns  
s.refund_flag  

4. **Extracting date dimensions for reporting**  
YEAR(s.datetime_local)  AS year,  
MONTH(s.datetime_local) AS month  

5. **Deduplicating on load (incremental)**  
WHERE NOT EXISTS (  
    SELECT 1  
    FROM sales_reconciliation_fact fact  
    WHERE fact.transaction_id = s.transaction_id  
      AND fact.channel = s.channel  
)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Automation (Snowflake Task)
- Created a **daily scheduled Snowflake Task** `refresh_sales_fact`:  
  - Runs at **2 AM UTC**  
  - Inserts only **new transactions** from staging tables into `sales_reconciliation_fact`  
  - Leaves existing rows untouched ‚Üí **incremental loads**, not full rebuilds

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Current Workflow
1. **New file lands in S3** ‚Üí Snowpipe detects and loads into staging table  
2. **Daily at 2 AM UTC** ‚Üí Task runs transformation SQL ‚Üí Inserts only new rows into fact table  
3. `sales_reconciliation_fact` always contains:  
   - All channels  
   - All currencies converted to USD  
   - Refunds tracked  
   - Year/Month fields for easy reporting
